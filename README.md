## SOP (Statement of Purpose)

3.3 Personal statement

It’s misleading that the personal statement is called a “personal” statement, since
what admission committees are really looking for is a research statement. What
admission committees want is a statement about what research you have done, what
research you hope to do, and why you like research.

Here’s a template if you need one:

i. First paragraph – Describe the general areas of research that interest you and
why. (This is helpful for a committee to determine which professors should
read your application.)

ii. Second paragraph, Third, and Fourth paragraphs – Describe some research
projects that you worked on. What was the problem you were trying to
solve? Why was it important? What approaches did you try? What did you
learn? It’s fine to say that you were unable to fully solve your problem.

iii. Fifth paragraph – Tell us why you feel you need a Ph.D.. Look back to
section 2 and explain what in there appealed to you.

iv. Sixth paragraph – Tell us why you want to come to CMU. Whom might you
like to work with? What papers have you looked at from CMU that you
enjoyed reading? Why is CMU the right place for you?
It’s important to realize that the research statement is not a commitment to do
research in that area. A third of all applicants end up working in an area different
from that which they described on their research statement.
